            <p class='cardText'>On Tuesday, China's National People's Congress Standing Committee unanimously passed a controversial national security law for Hong Kong. The law, which criminalises acts of secession, subversion, foreign interference and terrorism, was promulgated
                and gazetted on the same day with immediate effect. Details were only revealed late at night as it was directly inserted into the Annex III of the semi-autonomous regionâ€™s mini-constitution, bypassing the local legislature.
